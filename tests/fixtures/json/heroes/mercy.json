After the organization’s fall, and with the coming of a new war, she wonders if she will ever know peace in her lifetime.","media":{"type":"short-story","link":"https://overwatch.blizzard.com/media/stories/valkyrie"},"chapters":[{"title":"Overwatch","content":"A longtime family friend of Torbjörn Lindholm, Ziegler had pioneered a breakthrough in the field of applied nanobiology at a young age. The technology radically improved the treatment of life-threatening illnesses and injuries. It was this expertise that attracted the attention of Overwatch. Because her parents had been taken by war, Ziegler was opposed to the organization's militaristic approach to keeping global peace. Ultimately, she recognized that Overwatch offered her the opportunity to save lives on a much larger scale. As Overwatch's head of medical research, Ziegler sought to leverage her work for healing in frontline crises. The result was the Valkyrie swift-response suit, which Ziegler herself piloted on many Overwatch missions. Despite her contributions to Overwatch, she was often at odds with her superiors and the organization's overarching aims. Though she lent her brilliant mind to healing her comrades, Ziegler had dire concerns about the affairs of Blackwatch, specifically pertaining to Commander Reyes and his own medical support, Moira O’Deorain. When Overwatch dissolved, Ziegler sought distance from the agency and re-dedicated herself to helping those affected by war, caring for the broken and dispossessed in crisis areas around the world.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt12c536b770bfdcd4/63880edf443fa70e71d4bfcd/mercy-00.jpg"},{"title":"Post overwatch","content":"Following the Overwatch Recall, two squad mates she had thought to be dead and gone arrived at her doorstep: Jack Morrison and Ana Amari. Ziegler’s feelings on the return of Overwatch were further complicated, seeing Morrison's obsession with chasing vengeance for the agency’s fall from grace. Yet, when Talon forces descended on Cairo, Mercy appeared without fail, to protect the city’s civilians alongside her old teammates. Although she, Soldier: 76, and Ana Amari have since parted ways, the events in Cairo rekindled a sense of heroism that Ziegler had thought to be long buried. With Null Sector's targeted attack on Paris, it was clear that Overwatch was needed once again to defend the world from threats to peace. Now knowing her battle is not yet over, Mercy has since returned to Overwatch, and can be counted on to don her Valkyrie suit whenever innocents are imperiled.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt9d92a71c1b2111fc/63880edf3b13b1106f74ec5c/mercy-01.jpg"}]}}
