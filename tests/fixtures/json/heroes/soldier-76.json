It is unknown whether he seeks justice... or revenge.","media":{"type":"video","link":"https://youtu.be/cPRRupAM4DI"},"chapters":[{"title":"Vigilante","content":"Soldier: 76 revealed himself in a string of attacks that crisscrossed the globe, targeting financial institutions, shadowy corporations, and secure Overwatch facilities. Though to the outside world his motives are inscrutable, there are those who claim that he is a former Overwatch agent, determined to shed light on the conspiracy that brought down the organization. Few would believe that former Overwatch Strike Commander Jack Morrison is the face behind Soldier: 76, given that Morrison was presumed dead during the destruction of Overwatch’s Swiss Headquarters. But the hardened veteran survived, perhaps due to the fact that he was biologically enhanced and trained as a member of the United States Soldier Enhancement Program, a top secret agency which surfaced only during the most desperate hour of the Omnic Crisis. As such, Morrison possesses physical capabilities exceeding those of a conventional soldier's, as well as other augmentations that make him a peerless combatant. In addition, he utilizes a cutting-edge arsenal, much of it stolen in raids on Overwatch installations.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt530523018f1ff248/6388100c6f080311223b5524/soldier-00.jpg"},{"title":"Recall","content":"Though Morrison did intercept Winston’s Overwatch recall broadcast, he remained singularly focused on his hunt for vengeance. The former commander came close to his prize in Egypt, where he crossed paths with several former Overwatch agents: his head of medical research, Dr. Angela Ziegler; captain, Ana Amari; and perhaps the biggest shock of all: Blackwatch Commander Gabriel Reyes, now hunting former Overwatch agents as the Reaper. Though Morrison fought the Reaper several times in Egypt, the wraith slipped through his fingers. The search for answers goes on. Luckily, Soldier: 76 is unrelenting in his search to find those responsible for Overwatch's fall, and bring them to justice.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt43566dc9446cf327/6388100c5148880e83ab70cf/soldier-01.jpg"}]}}
