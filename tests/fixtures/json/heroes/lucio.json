But when the Vishkar Corporation redeveloped the city and cracked down on the community, Lúcio reclaimed his father’s sonic technology from the corporation and used it to rally his people to action. Now an international celebrity, he inspires social change through his music and actions.","media":null,"chapters":[{"title":"Early life","content":"Lúcio Correia dos Santos grew up in Rio de Janeiro, in a poor and crowded favela that was hit hard by the financial upheaval following the Omnic Crisis. As Brazil began the long process of recovery, he wanted to find a way to lift the spirits of those around him. He found his answer in music and its power to bring people together and even help them forget their troubles, if only for a short time. He performed on street corners, in block parties, and as he got older, at a string of legendary underground shows.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt5ad03779a268c4f4/637da195a4a28e10bf84d6f6/lucio-00.jpg"},{"title":"Activist","content":"But Lúcio's close-knit community was thrown into chaos when the multinational Vishkar Corporation secured a contract to redevelop large tracts of the city. Lúcio and his neighbors had been told that the development would improve their lives. However, that promise never became a reality. Vishkar imposed controls on the residents in the name of building a more orderly society: enforcing curfews, cracking down on what the company perceived as lawless behavior, and exploiting the populace as a cheap labor force. Lúcio wouldn't stand for it. He seized the Vishkar sonic technology that his father had helped develop—technology that was now being used to suppress the people—and converted it into a tool to rally them to action. In a popular uprising, they drove Vishkar out of their neighborhoods. Lúcio's leadership made him a star overnight and a symbol for positive social change. His music skyrocketed in popularity. Whereas he had once performed locally, he was now filling arenas across the world.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt1770eaa8a19a1a40/637da1956663180e7cbbce55/lucio-01.jpg"},{"title":"Recording artist","content":"Among his newfound fans was the brilliant young inventor, Efi Oladele. In the aftermath of Doomfist’s attack on Numbani, Lúcio helped Efi source a special reactor for her robot Orisa, whom Efi was building to become a stronger protector for Numbani. He also agreed to perform a benefit concert in Unity Square to fundraise for victims of Doomfist’s attack. Talon crashed the concert but was successfully repelled by the combined efforts of Lúcio, Efi, and Orisa. With the sum of his experiences, Lúcio realized the power his platform held, and continues to make a difference with his music, changing the world for the better.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt2cd33b648726ce63/637da1955148880e83ab6fbf/lucio-02.jpg"}]}}
