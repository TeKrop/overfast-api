Shortly after returning home, she killed her husband and vanished. Now, “Widowmaker” is Talon's most effective weapon, a patient, ruthlessly efficient operative who rarely shows emotion and remorse, and revels only in the moment of the kill.","media":{"type":"video","link":"https://youtu.be/U130wnpi-C0"},"chapters":[{"title":"Early life","content":"In her former life, Amélie Lacroix loved only two things: her husband and ballet. Growing up in her family’s ancestral seat of Chateau Guillard in rural France, dance became Amélie’s only escape from the crumbling manor and her conservative family, who had always urged her to follow the aristocracy’s tenets of decorum and tradition. Her path would take a more interesting turn when she married the great love of her life, Gérard Lacroix, an Overwatch agent spearheading operations against the Talon terrorist organization. Amélie gave little thought to her husband’s career outside the interesting topic it made for dinner parties; she could hardly have guessed at the danger his job put her in.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt6472a4aeb51aa3b2/638810adc72c2b107a6f7ddc/widowmaker-00.jpg"},{"title":"Neural reconditioning","content":"After several unsuccessful attempts to eliminate Gérard, Talon decided to change its focus to his wife. In the dead of night, Talon operatives kidnapped Amélie and subjected her to an intense program of neural reconditioning, in effect creating a sleeper agent. Gerard devoted Overwatch’s every resource to recovering his bride, and it wasn’t long before the operation produced results. His agents saved Amélie, and a medical and psychological evaluation after the kidnapping found her to be apparently no worse for wear. Their official assessment proved fatally inaccurate two weeks later . . . when they discovered she had killed Gérard in his sleep. Overwatch had never truly rescued Amélie Lacroix. They had merely delivered Widowmaker to her first victim. Afterward, Amélie was hunted by police and Overwatch alike, but more than that, she was haunted by the way murdering her husband had made her feel. The moment of the kill was the most alive Amélie had ever felt.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blteec179d006096c80/638810adf9f61910b4235893/widowmaker-01.jpg"},{"title":"Talon","content":"With few other options left, Amélie returned to Talon, chasing the high that had both thrilled and terrified her. At her behest, she was given extensive training in the covert arts and agreed to participate in an experimental marksman program. Talon’s geneticist, Moira O’Deorain, altered Amélie’s physiology to improve her aim, drastically slowing her heart, which turned her skin cold and blue, and numbed her ability to experience human emotion. It dulled the pain of what she’d done, while heightening the charge she felt on the hunt. Now as Widowmaker, she is Talon's most effective assassin. She shot (and had presumably killed) Captain Ana Amari—then the second in command of Overwatch—during a mission in Poland. Shortly after, she assisted the Reaper and Sombra in securing Dr. Siebren de Kuiper for Talon’s ends. More recently she was sighted at the Overwatch Museum in New York, attempting to steal the Doomfist gauntlet; in Russia, at the near-assassination of the head of Volskaya Industries; and in Venice, where her handiwork was apparent amid the murders of Augusto Vialli and his associates. But Widowmaker is perhaps most notorious for her assassination of the Shambali leader, Tekhartha Mondatta at a rally for peace in King’s Row. Though she was intercepted by former Overwatch agent, Tracer, even the hero couldn’t keep Widowmaker from claiming her prize. An unstoppable killer, Widowmaker’s crosshairs are perhaps the most dangerous place in the world.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt1bf3595bec1e17e6/638810adedd0a0105dfd2371/widowmaker-02.jpg"}]}}
