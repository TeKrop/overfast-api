Sadly, the cryostasis lasted far longer than intended, and Mei awoke nine years later as the only survivor in a damaged station. With the help of her robot companion, Snowball, Mei invented new technology to escape Antarctica and join up with the new Overwatch.","media":{"type":"video","link":"https://youtu.be/8tjcm_kI0n0"},"chapters":[{"title":"Overwatch","content":"With escalating climate phenomena ravaging environments around the globe, Overwatch established a series of ecopoints at remote, critical locations worldwide. Their mission was to study ecological challenges and provide solutions for stabilizing or reversing its most pressing issues. Mei-Ling Zhou was a member of this multiyear initiative. A peerless climatologist, she had introduced cutting-edge innovations in the field of climate manipulation that protected at-risk areas in Asia and beyond. She was assigned to the program's monitoring station at Ecopoint: Antarctica when disaster struck: a sudden, catastrophic polar storm battered the installation and cut it off from the outside world, leaving the facility damaged and the scientists stranded. As their supplies dwindled, they entered cryostasis to survive until supply lines could be re-established or a rescue attempt could be made. But that rescue never came. It was years later when the team's cryogenics chamber finally opened; Mei was the team’s only survivor. The world Mei awoke to had gone through considerable changes: Overwatch was no more, the serious climate issues had worsened, and none of the ecopoints were in operation. Any clues their research had uncovered were lost.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt8c3799aa6fd3c033/637da19a443fa70e71d4beeb/mei-00.jpg"},{"title":"Recall","content":"But there was hope: upon reconnecting to the outside world, Mei received Winston’s Overwatch Recall missive. She joined up with Winston and Tracer at Watchpoint: Gibraltar and decided to continue her climatology work, penning a public journal that detailed her experience. Equipped with a portable version of her climate-manipulation technology, she traveled the world hoping to re-establish Overwatch’s ecological research network and track down the causes of the threats to the planet's ecosystem. Mei put her personal mission on hold to support the re-formed Overwatch team in halting the devastating attack by Null Sector on the city of Paris. With her incredible technology and her sharp mind, Mei strives to build a future that protects both the planet and the people who call it home.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/bltc6785d42c3a65f1b/63880eb8f9f61910b423588f/mei-01.jpg"}]}}
