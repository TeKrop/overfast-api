From her youth, Brigitte was inspired by the tales of valor she heard from her godfather, Reinhardt. When she came of age, she became the squire to his knight. The two have joined the new Overwatch, hoping to right the wrongs of the world.","media":{"type":"video","link":"https://youtu.be/K_m8fcJb5tE"},"chapters":[{"title":"Ironclad","content":"The youngest daughter of weapons designer, Torbjörn Lindholm, Brigitte was the first of his children to show an interest in mechanical engineering. Brigitte spent much of her spare time in her father's workshop, learning the trade and honing her skills. Her aptitude for engineering mirrored that of her father's, but Brigitte's primary interest was in armor fabrication and defensive systems, unlike Torbjörn, who was world-renowned (and perhaps infamous) for the weapons he created. Everyone expected that Brigitte would continue her apprenticeship and follow in her father's footsteps. But her plans changed due to the influence of another prominent figure in her life, her father's fellow Overwatch agent, Reinhardt Wilhelm. A close friend of the family and Brigitte's godfather, Reinhardt told Brigitte tales of heroes and chivalry as she grew up. After his retirement and Overwatch's fall, Reinhardt declared that he would become a knight-errant on a quest to bring justice. Before he left on his adventures, Brigitte surprised him by asking to join him as his squire. Reinhardt accepted.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt7a7354b508be474b/637da148a86e5310c692c01b/brigitte-00.jpg"},{"title":"Squire","content":"As a squire, Brigitte had many responsibilities, the most important of which was the upkeep of Reinhardt's Crusader armor (a design she was familiar with as the current version was designed by her father). But more and more, she found her main job was taking care of Reinhardt himself. During a journey through Europe, the duo discovered a village under the heel of a local gang known as the Dragons. In his overenthusiasm, Reinhardt nearly lost the fight. Brigitte did her best to repair his armor with minimal parts, and bandage up her mentor, as his body was breaking down from years of combat. Though Reinhardt was triumphant against the Dragons, Brigitte realized that serving only as a mechanic wasn't enough and that the best way she could continue on their journey was to become a warrior in her own right. While Reinhardt trained her in combat, Brigitte built her own suit of armor. The Overwatch Recall brought them from the ruins of Eichenwald to the streets of Paris, where Brigitte fought at Reinhardt's side to protect him, and any others in need, from the ravages of Null Sector. No matter what threats they face, knight and squire continue their journey to make the world a better place, one battle at a time.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/bltb223aa8661613921/637da148e5d09810cdaff5bc/brigitte-01.jpg"}]}}
