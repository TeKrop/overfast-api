He was believed dead following an explosion at Overwatch’s headquarters. But rumors say he escaped his fate, and now works as the volatile killer known only as Reaper, one of Talon’s deadliest enforcers","media":{"type":"short-story","link":"https://overwatch.blizzard.com/media/stories/code-of-violence/"},"chapters":[{"title":"Sightings","content":"The Reaper is an extremely volatile mercenary, a ruthless and remorseless killer responsible for terrorist attacks across the world . . . In New Mexico, where scientist Siebren de Kuiper was kidnapped from a black site facility. In Russia, amid an assassination plot against Volskaya Industries’ Katya Volskaya. In Venice, where the body of Talon leader Augusto Vialli was found amid the carnage. Even in more public places—the Overwatch Museum in New York—Reaper was narrowly thwarted in stealing the Doomfist gauntlet. Survivors have described a black shadow ghosting unscathed through the most hellish battlefields. The few bodies recovered of those he kills are pale, empty husks drained of life, their cells showing signs of intense degradation. It is possible that he is a byproduct of failed genetic alteration which forces his cells to simultaneously decay and regenerate at a hyper-accelerated rate. Those tracking his movements have begun to see a pattern in his appearances. They believe that the Reaper is hunting former Overwatch agents and systematically eliminating them, a hypothesis supported by his infiltration of Watchpoint: Gibraltar, where he sought a list of the names and locations of former Overwatch agents. His breach was only partially successful, as he and his team were driven into retreat by Winston.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/bltc8039f1e9d655c9a/637da1c55148880e83ab6fc7/reaper-00.jpg"},{"title":"Talon","content":"The truth, known to few, is that the Reaper is former Blackwatch Commander Gabriel Reyes, long thought deceased in the destruction of Overwatch’s Swiss Headquarters. After Overwatch’s capture of Doomfist, Reyes was swayed to Talon’s side, frustrated by the bureaucracy and red tape that constantly kept him from attaining true justice in Overwatch. In Egypt, Reyes came face to face with two other restless ghosts from his past: former Overwatch Strike Commander Jack Morrison and Captain Ana Amari. Though the three comrades had little to say to each other, their paths are likely to cross again. After all, their names are among the many on Reaper’s list.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt591fbd11f846c7a4/63880f833cbefd11108111d5/reaper-01.jpg"}]}}
