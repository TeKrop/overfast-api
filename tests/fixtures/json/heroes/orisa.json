When the duo successfully repelled an attack from Talon’s Doomfist, they became known as national heroes. Now, Orisa stands ready to protect those in need, using her power for good.","media":{"type":"video","link":"https://youtu.be/Lvm0of3iDUU"},"chapters":[{"title":"Efi oladele","content":"Originally put into service before the Omnic Crisis, the OR14 \"Idina\" line of security robots was built in Nigeria's massive manufacturing omnium. After the war, they were taken out of production, along with many of the other models used during the Crisis. Twenty years later, Numbani revived and recommissioned the OR14 program to protect the city from external threats. These new OR15s were deployed for a short time before they were destroyed in an attack by Doomfist. Following the attack, the program was scrapped, and the civic government sold off the remaining OR15 inventory. Some parts were purchased by eleven-year-old Efi Oladele, a brilliant girl whose early accomplishments in robotics and artificial intelligence had already earned her the Adawe Foundation's prestigious \"genius grant.\" With the approval of her understanding and open-minded parents, Efi spent the bulk of her grant money to acquire one of the decommissioned OR15 bots. She believed that Numbani needed a protector and that an upgraded OR15 could do just that. Efi repaired and reconfigured the robot and installed a personality core that she had designed herself. She named Numbani's newest hero Orisa.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt9e0f7cc3a931b4b3/63880f12a4a28e10bf84d830/orisa-00.jpg"},{"title":"Hero of numbani","content":"Though Orisa was a marvel when activated, Efi spent a long time finding her optimal protocols. The robot’s inexperience could cause her to be a liability, especially in learning her own strength. But when Talon began an orchestrated attack on the City of Harmony, Efi knew Orisa’s programming would likely be put to the test. Luckily Efi had just been gifted with the final piece she needed for Orisa’s defensive capabilities: a Tobelstein reactor from Lúcio. While Efi was a superfan of Lúcio's music, Lúcio was a superfan of Efi’s ingenuity. He agreed to perform a benefit concert in Numbani for the victims of Doomfist’s attack. During Lúcio's concert in Unity Square, Talon struck. Orisa teamed up with Lúcio to defend the concertgoers from Doomfist, who was determined to sow fear in the populace. While Orisa, Efi, and Lúcio succeeded in protecting Numbani, they knew peace was a gift to be carefully guarded. After expelling Talon from Numbani, Efi and Orisa met with former Overwatch Commander Sojourn about what it meant to be a hero. Efi took Sojourn’s words to heart and used the experience to think out new upgrades for Orisa. As Orisa continues to grow with her brilliant creator at her side, one thing seems certain: Numbani’s future is in good hands.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt92fe22c967d136bc/63880f12e5d09810cdaff697/orisa-01.jpg"}]}}
