Though she was thought to have perished in a firefight with Talon, Ana has rejoined the fray to protect her country, family, and closest allies.","media":{"type":"video","link":"https://youtu.be/yzFWIw7wV8Q"},"chapters":[{"title":"Overwatch","content":"As the Omnic Crisis inflicted a heavy toll on Egypt, the country's depleted and undermanned armed forces relied on elite snipers for support. Among them was Ana Amari, who was widely considered to be the world's best. Her superior marksmanship, decision-making, and instincts made her a natural selection to join the Overwatch strike team that would end the war. Following the success of Overwatch's original mission, Ana served for many years as Strike Commander Morrison's second-in-command. Despite her responsibilities in leading the organization, Ana refused to step away from combat operations. She remained on active duty well into her fifties, until she was believed to have been killed during a hostage rescue mission by the Talon operative known as Widowmaker.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt26f888b741ac09bb/638807c1113983111ba8cfa9/ana_00.jpg"},{"title":"Post overwatch","content":"In truth, Ana survived that encounter, despite being gravely wounded and losing her right eye. During her recovery, she wrestled with the weight of a life spent in combat, and she chose to stay out of the world's growing conflicts. However, as time passed, she realized she could not sit on the sidelines while people threatened her city and the innocents around her. Ana rejoined the fight, this time as a healer, and dedicated herself to monitoring global security threats. Prior to disrupting Talon operations in Cairo, she intercepted an unlikely broadcast: the Overwatch Recall from her former friend, Winston.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt337560e347894727/638807fa6663180e7cbbcf88/ana_01.jpg"},{"title":"Recall","content":"Ana remained uncertain about the Recall, but she had decided to help her comrades from the shadows. She sent word to Cole Cassidy, knowing that he had survived the demise of Overwatch and returned as a gunslinger for hire. Ana knew the organization needed new blood—people like Cassidy and her daughter, Pharah—were it to stand a chance, and worried the old guard would only poison the agency’s return. She shared as much with her daughter in an overdue reunion, before embarking on her own mission with Soldier: 76. With no regrets left, Ana travels the world tracking down Talon and the ghosts that haunt her former allies. And while she didn’t rejoin Overwatch, Ana keeps her eye on their exploits just in case.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/bltc1bd29f5c953e0f4/638807fa3b13b1106f74ec4c/ana_02.jpg"}]}}
