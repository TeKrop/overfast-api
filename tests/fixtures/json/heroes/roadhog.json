Roaming the irradiated, wreckage-littered Australian outback, his only known associate (and many wonder why) is the manic young Junker criminal known as Junkrat.","media":{"type":"video","link":"https://youtu.be/_q0QGtk_AM0"},"chapters":[{"title":"Australian liberation front","content":"Mako Rutledge was one of the many inhabitants of the Australian Outback whose land was seized and used for the construction of an omnium. But in the wake of the Omnic Crisis, the government made a controversial move, gifting the land to the omnics who had nearly destroyed their country, in hopes of establishing a long-term peace accord. This agreement permanently displaced Mako and a large number of the area's residents: a scattered collection of survivalists, solar farmers, and people who just wanted to be left alone. Furious over the loss of their homes, Mako and the residents turned to violent rebellion. They formed the Australian Liberation Front and struck against the omnium and its robot population to take back the lands that had been stolen from them. Events continued to escalate until the ALF sabotaged the omnium's fusion core, which resulted in an explosion that destroyed the omnium, irradiated the surrounding area, and littered the Outback with twisted metal and wreckage for miles around. Mako watched as his home became an apocalyptic wasteland, and he was forever changed. Adapting to his environment, he donned a mask and took to the broken highways of the Outback on his ramshackle chopper. Little by little, his humanity was forgotten. The last vestiges of Mako faded away and the ruthless killer Roadhog was born.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blta1267b8aa2078ce1/637da1d146a48b0e063e4a9d/roadhog-00.jpg"},{"title":"Junker","content":"Roadhog set up shop on the outskirts of Junkertown, a thorn in the side of the town’s reigning monarch, the Junker Queen. He didn’t care—he was there for his gas and everyone else could rot. That held true until a chance encounter with Junkrat forged a lasting partnership, based in part on a 50% cut of a legendary lost treasure. Better it go to him than the queen.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt4565b257dd867cf6/637da1d2d44c1b0e1f0e8bb4/roadhog-01.jpg"},{"title":"Wanted criminal","content":"Exiled from Junkertown, the pair roamed Australia for a short while and even met with the CEO of Hyde Global, who hired them to reclaim a warehouse taken over by omnic terrorists. The duo soon realized they had been set up as part of an insurance scam. Though the job was a bust, it gave them the kick they needed to launch an international crime spree. Roadhog eventually returned to Junkertown, where Junkrat loudly disclosed their big plan to get payback on the Queen for their exile. The plan immediately failed thanks to the gate warden within earshot. Now, the duo has nothing left but money, useless disguises, and soon-to-detonate explosives.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt2c1b0477d4a1c175/637da1d1f9f61910b4235785/roadhog-02.jpg"}]}}
