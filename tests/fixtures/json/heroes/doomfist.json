Rising through the ranks, he killed his boss – the previous Doomfist – taking his eponymous weapon and title. Now, he is determined to plunge the world into a new conflict for his own mysterious purposes.","media":{"type":"video","link":"https://youtu.be/vaZfZFNuOpI"},"chapters":[{"title":"Omnic crisis","content":"Akande Ogundimu was the son of a wealthy Nigerian family who owned a prosthetic-technology company. Well-trained and proficient in a wide spectrum of bone-shattering fighting styles, Ogundimu’s stellar professional fighting career was cut short with the loss of his right arm during the Omnic Crisis. And while his family’s technology could replace his arm, without the challenge and crucible of competition, Ogundimu felt utterly lost. In that time, he searched for something to devote himself to. It was only when the current Doomfist, Akinjide Adeyemi, tapped him to join his ranks that Ogundimu saw his way forward.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/bltd16eae51df615e53/637da152113983111ba8ceca/doomfist-00.jpg"},{"title":"Talon","content":"Ogundimu was trained by Adeyemi himself and became one of his most trusted confidants, excelling not only because of his physical enhancements, but because he was extraordinarily well-suited for the work. He understood the importance of discipline and leadership, and possessed an iron will that was unmatched. It was not long before Talon also recognized his formidable skills. Before long, Adeyemi’s protégé made a fateful choice for the good of Talon. Ogundimu slayed his mentor, and assumed the mantle of Doomfist—taking on both the infamous weapon and the name. Talon understood the new Doomfist was an unmatched strategist, capable of leading both Talon’s military arm and its dealings that required more subterfuge. He would be the perfect replacement, and the rest of the organization began to fall in line. Under Doomfist, Talon underwent a significant transformation to become not just a ubiquitous shadow presence throughout the world, but a private military organization as well. This would prove a difficult balancing act, yet Doomfist was sure that they could always influence, obfuscate, or terminate any who got too close to the truth.\n Eight years prior to Null Sector’s global assault, Doomfist was captured by an Overwatch strike team that included Tracer, Winston, and Genji. He was imprisoned in a maximum-security facility, where he waited patiently for his plots to play out. It was only when he sensed the time had come that he broke out of his prison and recovered his gauntlet. Now, Doomfist has retaken his place in Talon, ready to drive the organization and humanity to its natural point of refinement through global conflict.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/bltfed94072364f5758/637da1515148880e83ab6fbb/doomfist-01.jpg"}]}}
