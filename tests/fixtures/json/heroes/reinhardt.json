One of the founders of Overwatch, for decades he was a force for good the world over. After the organization’s fall, he travelled Europe like a knight of old, defending the innocent alongside his squire, Brigitte, until Winston’s call brought them back into the arms of Overwatch.","media":{"type":"video","link":"https://youtu.be/sQfk5HykiEk"},"chapters":[{"title":"Overwatch","content":"A highly decorated German soldier, Reinhardt was part of the Crusaders, battle-hardened warriors who wore massive suits of armor with unique capabilities. Although his mentor, Balderich von Adler, was Overwatch’s first choice to join the agency, Reinhardt was recruited after von Adler fell in the Battle of Eichenwald. Reinhardt became part of the original Overwatch strike team that put an end to the Omnic Crisis. After the conflict's resolution, Overwatch grew into a global institution, keeping the peace in a war-torn world. Reinhardt's unique ethics and larger-than-life persona earned the admiration of his peers and superiors alike. Never afraid to speak his mind, he was Overwatch's most vocal supporter and, when necessary, its harshest critic, providing a constant reminder that Overwatch was meant to be a force for good. Having served into his late fifties, Reinhardt was faced with mandatory retirement from combat operations. Despondent about being removed from active duty, Reinhardt feared that his days of purpose and glory had ended. As times grew darker and Overwatch came under suspicion of corruption and sedition, Reinhardt could only watch as the cause he had dedicated his life to defending surrendered in disgrace.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/bltf0f4690e670265cd/63880faf8b3bbe1129cea610/reinhardt-00.jpg"},{"title":"Post overwatch","content":"Though Overwatch was eventually disbanded, Reinhardt was not content to sit idly by while the world fell to disorder. Once again donning his Crusader armor, he vowed to fight for justice across Europe like a knight of old, defending the innocent and winning hearts and minds with the promise of better days to come. He was joined on this mission by his squire, Brigitte Lindholm, daughter of Reinhardt’s close friend , Torbjörn. After one particularly close call with a local gang calling themselves the Dragons, Brigitte took up her own mace to fight by her mentor’s side.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/bltd01aa64f8857d54e/637da1bd6663180e7cbbce59/reinhardt-01.jpg"},{"title":"Recall","content":"The old knight visited Eichenwalde after Winston triggered the Overwatch Recall. Brigitte urged him to consider the request carefully, reminding Reinhardt of how leadership had forced him out and pleading to him that, particularly given his advanced age, he had given Overwatch enough. Reinhardt was undeterred. He was called to duty, and a Crusader must always answer the call.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt4c409b02f49f1d4f/63880faf6f080311223b5520/reinhardt-02.jpg"}]}}
