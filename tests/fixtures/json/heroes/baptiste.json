With limited opportunities and resources, he enlisted in the military. The Caribbean Coalition, a pan-island force formed in response to the Crisis, became his new home. Guided by his innate desire to help people, Baptiste chose the path of a combat medic and served in an elite branch of the Caribbean Coalition’s special ops. After his service was complete, Baptiste struggled to find a demand for his unique skills. He turned to one of the few opportunities open to him: joining the Talon mercenary group, one of the many organizations that were poised to profit off the chaos in the war's aftermath.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt0f443d0356708994/63880871bbfd340e8ad2e417/baptiste-00.jpg"},{"title":"Talon","content":"For the first time ever, Baptiste had a taste of the good life. Talon's missions were easy and paid well, and he put aside some of his earnings to set up a clinic in his hometown. But slowly, his unit's orders escalated in brutality, expanding into assassinations and operations with civilian casualties. Confronted by his team's actions, Baptiste realized he was perpetuating a cycle of violence like the one that had destroyed his own community. He abandoned Talon, disgusted with what he had done and determined to forge a new path for himself. But Talon would not let him go. Baptiste knew too much, and they sent operatives to silence him. Agent after agent came for him, including Baptiste's former comrades. To stay under the radar, Baptiste drifted from place to place, aiding in humanitarian efforts around the globe. The few Talon members who managed to track him down were never seen again.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt220fbd7560b2fc68/638808715148880e83ab70c5/baptiste-01.jpg"},{"title":"On the run","content":"After years on the run, Baptiste returned to his native Haiti to help the clinic he’d co-founded, an action that allowed Talon to spring a carefully laid trap. Mauga and Trung Le Nguyen, fellow Talon soldiers urged Baptiste to accompany them on a mission to shake down a local businessman, or fight—and die—now. To survive, Baptiste agreed, but when Baptiste found out the man had valuable intel about Overwatch, he saved him. His old friend, Mauga, gave Baptiste one final chance to return to Talon outside of a body bag, but he refused, escaping with the valuable intel: the list of names and locations to which Winston had broadcast Overwatch’s Recall. The hit list of known and likely Overwatch agents spurred Baptiste to warn those unfortunate enough to find their names on it, beginning with Dr. Angela Ziegler. In his efforts to locate Ziegler, Baptiste instead crossed paths with a suspicious Cassidy on his own mission to recruit global heroes for a renewed Overwatch. As Cassidy and Baptiste fell within Talon's crosshairs, their chance encounter and unlikely partnership gave Baptiste a chance at the redemption he sought. Baptiste now works toward a better world, healing where he can and fighting when he must. He knows that he cannot undo his past—but that making a difference now is what matters.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt125347168b027b51/637da13e46a48b0e063e4a91/baptiste-02.jpg"}]}}
