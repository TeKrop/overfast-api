Ambitious and calculating, Ashe rebelled and formed the Deadlock Gang, which quickly gained infamy in the criminal underworld. Convincing the gangs of the Southwest to work together, Ashe has branded herself a legend, restoring the notoriety of the once-wild West.","media":{"type":"video","link":"https://youtu.be/yvT9wKCrEyo"},"chapters":[{"title":"Early life","content":"Born into a wealthy family, Ashe grew up surrounded by privilege. Her parents owned the Arbalest Arms Company, a family business which had grown in power and scope during the Omnic Crisis. While the couple had little interest in weaponry or tech, they had become highly sought-after business consultants and coaches for the global elite. Though her parents paid little attention to her (mostly leaving her in the care of the family’s omnic butler, B.O.B., they ensured that Ashe had every opportunity to succeed. But a chance meeting with a local ruffian named Cole Cassidy, and an impromptu string of crimes committed together, opened her eyes to her true calling. The satisfaction of outwitting her targets and the thrill of getting away with it set her on the outlaw path.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/bltc6f4b34d356c0754/637da13646a48b0e063e4a8d/ashe-00.jpg"},{"title":"Deadlock rebel","content":"Along with the other three founders of the Deadlock Rebels , Ashe started to make a name for herself with bigger and more extravagant heists. Her actions ultimately attracted the attention of Overwatch, who busted the gang early into their exploits, taking Cassidy into custody. The Deadlock Gang’s rapid rise to prominence put them at odds with more than just law enforcement, too. The other criminal organizations in the American Southwest wanted a piece of their pie; the encounters often became violent. After years of skirmishes and bloodshed, Ashe called the heads of the major groups together. Ashe saw the potential to grow the influence of all. She used what she’d learned from her parents’ business to bring order to these groups. Her proposal was that the gangs could work together (or at least, not work against each other). No longer having to focus her energies on squabbles with the other gangs, Ashe wrote her name across the American Southwest with a string of audacious heists and operations that cemented her legacy as an outlaw legend. Her principles? Keep your word, don’t work with the law, respect each other’s territory, and always punish betrayal. Speaking of which, some decades after Cole Cassidy turned coat for Overwatch, the Deadlock Rebels received a tip regarding precious tech moving across their turf via hypertrain. Too lucrative to ignore, the gang planned a train heist, only to learn they were the ones being robbed. Cassidy incapacitated the gang and released Echo into the world, singlehandedly stealing Ashe’s bike, her score, and her shot at revenge. But in these uncertain times, one thing is certain: Ashe gets what she wants. And she and her Deadlock Rebels won't stop until they claim what's theirs (and likely, what's yours).","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt811b34d14ae2f336/63880844c72c2b107a6f7dd4/ashe-01.jpg"}]}}
